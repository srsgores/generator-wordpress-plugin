[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/srsgores/generator-wordpress-plugin.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/srsgores/generator-wordpress-plugin)

A wordpress plugin generator for Yeoman.

This will make your life a lot easier as a Wordpress plugin developer.  Simply type in your author information, and away you go.

## Getting started
1. Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed: `npm install -g yo`
2. Install the generator: `npm install -g generator-wordpress-plugin`
3. Run: `yo wordpress-plugin`
4. Provide the information as it is required

## Contributing
I have decided to use specific **coding standards** on this project:

1. Single quotes ``'`` must not be used.  Please use double quotes instead ``"``.  [Read why](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/242813/when-to-use-double-or-single-quotes-in-javascript/18041188#18041188)
2. Tab characters must be used at all times.  Tab characters should be set to 4 spaces for best results.  [Read why](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9231688/is-the-tab-character-bad-in-source-code/14078305#14078305)

If your editor supports it, the defaults will be loaded.
